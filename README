Apache Traffic Server

Traffic Server is a high-performance building block for cloud services.
It's more than just a caching proxy server; it also has support for
plugins to build large scale web applications.

1. BUILDING

  autoreconf -i          # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files
  ./configure            # configure the build environment to create Makefiles
  make                   # execute the compile
  sudo make install      # install.

  If these instructions do not work for you, you're probably not on
  Linux or OS X. If you're not on Linux or OS X, you should really
  know how to do this yourself.


2. INSTALLATION

  /usr/local/var/log/trafficserver   log files created at runtime
  /usr/local/var/trafficserver       runtime files
